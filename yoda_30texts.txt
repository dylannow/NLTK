The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are.
Hard to see, the dark side is.
Discover who this assassin is, we must.
With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her.
May the Force be with you.
Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
A vergence, you say?
But you do! Revealed your opinion is.
Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
Tested he will be.
Good, good, young one. How feel you?
Afraid are you?
See through you, we can.
Afraid to lose her, I think.
Everything. Fear is the path to the dark side, fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.
A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I sense much fear in you.
Then continue, we will.
Correct you were, Qui-Gon.
Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?
Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he has.
And draw out the Queen's attacker.
Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
May the Force be with you.
Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Council does. But agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.
The Chosen One the boy may be, nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be.
Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an apprentice.
